# SUMMER PROJECT

Get ready for this year's summer festival. With a new theme every year. Here you will find all the information that is important right now. We release artists from time to time and the tickets have not gone on sale yet.
If you want information before everyone else, you can sign up for the newsletters on the contact page.

The purpose of this website is to get important news right now in an easy way. You should also be able to dream of previous years by looking through the pictures on the gallery page.
