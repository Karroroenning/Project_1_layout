# SUMMER PROJECT

Get ready for this year's summer festival. With a new theme every year. Here you will find all the information that is important right now. We release artists from time to time and the tickets have not gone on sale yet.
If you want information before everyone else, you can sign up for the newsletters on the contact page.

The purpose of this website is to get important news in an easy way. You should also be able to dream of previous years by looking through the pictures on the gallery page.

## Features

### Existing Features

## - Landing page

**Navigation:**
 
The navigation is important to see clear so the user always can know were them want to go. It also have an underline under so the user can see which page them are on. The user can navigate through 3 pages "HOME", "GALLERY" and "CONTACT".

- I chose to put the navigation in the middle of the screen so that everything is centered here. It should be perceived as easy for the user to find the navigation.

**Loadingbox:**

This will be the first the user will see. This is a colorful "loadingbox" that provide info about how many days it's left before they release the tickets.

- The colors in the box have a meaning. The pink color is how much time has passed and the blue color is how much time is left until the tickets are released.

 **Dates:**

Information about when the festival takes place.

- I think it is important that the dates have the largest text size on the page. Because right now, that is the most important information. So the user can book into the calendar and take time off from work or school

 **Artist:**

Info about which artists have been released so far. The bigger the artists, the bigger the text.

- The artists are centered in vertical order. So that it doesn't get messy and crowded. Smooth, simple information to the user.

## - Gallery

Here we show pictures from the previous year. With small information text. It is important for us to show what happened in previous years so you know what to expect. Those who have attended in previous years can dream back by looking at the pictures.

- Here I have chosen to use a black background and faded text because here it is the images that should take focus from the user.

## - Contact

**Subscribe:**

Now is the time to sign up for the newsletter. Here we have different options where the user can tick the information you want in the email. This week's newsletter is already ticked.

- It is important that the user should be able to receive information before it appears on the website or at the same time as it is published. So they never miss anything. The user can decide which information is most important to them. After they press subscribe, a message appears that says thank you very much.

**Contact:**

If the user wants to get in touch with the suppliers, there is clear and concise information next to the subscription. Address, number and email.

- It should never be difficult to find the contact details. So that's why it has its own navigation and is clearly visible in the middle of the page.

## - Footer and social links

In the footer we have the social links. Where the user can check all their social platforms.

- The icons are in the same color theme as the main header. So that everything has a common thread. The icons are linked to e.g. Facebook. Stylish footer with simple icons.
